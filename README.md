# SDK_CSharpExample
C# Example for Zoiper SDK 2.0 for Windows desktop.

To be able to run the Zoiper C# Windows Example, you will need to include the zdk.net as a reference to the project and then to build it. 
By default zdk.net is not included in the example. 
If you still don't have the zdk.net library, please contact us on zoiper.com.
